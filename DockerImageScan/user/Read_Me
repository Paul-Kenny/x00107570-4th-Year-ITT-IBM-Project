 
###DO NOT DELETE the user/Report or the user/TemporaryDirectories folders!!!!###

The user/Report/Vulnerabilities_Reports folder will contain dynamically generated Docker image security vulnerabilities reports. These reports will automatically open in the users default browser once the image scan is complete.

The user/TemporaryDirectories folder is the directory in which temporary directories (required by the image scan) will be generated during the image scan. This directory will be empty at all other times.

To execute the Docker image security vulnerabilities scan execute the following command from the current ("user") directory: 

  gradle scan -PimageNameArg="<docker_image_Name>" 
  
Once the scan is comlete the security scan report will automatically open in the user's default browser. The report can be found in the Report/Vulnerabilities_Reports directory. The name of the report will take the following format <docker_image_name>(timestamp).html. If a copy of the report is being saved to another directory, please ensure that a copy of the user/Report/Vulnerabilities_Reports/css/ directory is saved also.
